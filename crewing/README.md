# Crewing

These are methods for people to support each other in small peer-to-peer mutual aid groups:

* **Pods**: personal-and-professional development in small groups, a new practice in development at Enspiral. Comprehensive [resources here](http://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/pods.html). \(For more on this: listen to the [recording of the Crews/Pods session at Enspiral Summer Retreat 2019](https://www.microsolidarity.cc/discussing/enspiral-summer-retreat-feb-2019); and [this update 6 months later](https://anchor.fm/Microsolidarity/episodes/Nati-and-john-talking-about-pods-at-Enspiral-e9giqj).\)
* [Case Clinic](https://www.presencing.org/resource/tools/case-clinic-desc) is a peer-coaching method from Theory U. It has a practical output \(helping someone with a challenge they're currently facing\), and it tends to produce a lot of insight and interpersonal bonding. It's an excellent place to start, you can get a long way in one meeting.
* [Feelz Circle](http://emotionalanarchism.com/how-to-form-a-radical-feelz-circle/): 3 processes for sharing emotional care between friends/ comrades/ lovers.
* Be The Change Earth Alliance use [Action Circles](https://www.bethechangeearthalliance.org/action_circles) to support people who want to change their life to be more ecologically sustainable. They have a comprehensive [best practice guide](https://www.bethechangeearthalliance.org/circle_guide) for convening these circles, including sample agendas, facilitation and communication tips,  etc.
* Mia Mingus wrote this excellent guide to [Pods and Pod Mapping](https://batjc.wordpress.com/pods-and-pod-mapping-worksheet/) for the Bay Area Transformative Justice Collective. In this context, your pod is "the people that you would call on if violence, harm or abuse happened to you; or the people that you would call on if you wanted support in taking accountability for violence, harm or abuse that you’ve done"
* The [Scuttlebutt](http://scuttlebutt.nz) software community are actively forming crews they call [Faerie Rings](https://hackmd.io/0iNeYQ9wR3qqerxjvfKnhg). Documentation currently focusses on how to do matchmaking to form crews within a congregation. Faerie Rings are mostly "get to know you" spaces for people who are participating in a big distributed project, but don't have many opportunities to connect face to face.
* [The Elephants](https://medium.com/things-ive-written/the-elephants-182870501589) long term personal development for Crews, focussed on goal-setting and accountability.
* [Working Out Loud](https://workingoutloud.com/en/circle-guides): a guided 12-week process for peer support in small groups, suitable for workplaces: _what am I trying to do? who is related to that goal? how can I contribute to them to deepen our relationship?_
* [Stewardship](https://loomio.coop/stewarding.html) peer support system for Partnerships.
* [Ako Groups](ako-group-guidelines.md): peer support within a learning context, e.g. university
* [How to give feedback in a small peer group](https://qualityswdev.com/2017/01/22/how-to-give-and-receive-feedback-in-an-agile-organization/). Written by Manuel Küblböck for a professional context, but the principles apply transcontextually.
* [How to host an Empathy Circle](http://cultureofempathy.com/Community/Handouts/How-To-Empathic-Listening.htm) - a simple group process to strengthen your empathy muscles.

## Forming

How is Crew formed? We're not sure. Rich's original [proposal](../articles/proposal.md) suggests the best way to meet your Crew-mates is in a Congregation: a larger gathering of people with some shared values and medium-high trust. The core patterns linked above may help, but there's many experiments to be done.

🔈[In this podcast](https://anchor.fm/emerge/episodes/Ria-Baeck---Emergent-Collective-Practice-and-Applied-Presence-e2qppp/a-a83fd7) with Daniel Thorson, Ria Baeck suggests the best place to start is at home, with a few guests gathered around a compelling question.
