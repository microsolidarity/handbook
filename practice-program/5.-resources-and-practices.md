### Practice & Processes for Crewing

* [Case Clinic](https://www.u-school.org/tools/case-clinic) - is a peer-coaching process from Theory U. It has a practical output (helping someone with a challenge they're currently facing), and it tends to produce a lot of insight and interpersonal bonding. It's an excellent place to start, you can get a long way in one meeting.
* [Peer Action Learning](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14CPT41OnSFmLJbsXle12kum8bkdq3B5z/view?usp=sharing) - process that allows participants to address real and immediate challenges they face and get support to find ways to move forward.
* [Project Kitchen](https://handbook.enspiral.com/guides/project\_kitchen) - Process to get support on a project
* [Feelz Circle](http://emotionalanarchism.com/how-to-form-a-radical-feelz-circle/) - 3 processes for sharing emotional care between friends/ comrades/ lovers.
* [Courage & Renewal](https://couragerenewal.org/courage-renewal-approach/) - approach from Parker Palmer for creating a circle of trust. Includes some guidance for cultivating a safe space for vulnerable conversations, plus great descriptions of why this is valuable.
