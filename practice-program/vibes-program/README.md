You'll also have access to a discussion forum to connect with other learners, share resources and ask us questions.

### Testimonials

Here are some quotes from previous participants

"It was mindblowing how quickly you can develop trust and belonging - I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it. We created a feeling of trust and safety within a few minutes, it's bonkers!"

"I only spoke to 3 people and already I got such a strong feeling that I want to get to know everyone here - I don't often feel that in a random group of people."

"It’s so helpful to do these peer-support processes with people who are outside my community - it’s so valuable to get the perspective of someone who cares but is not involved. It's usually hard to find. it takes a lot of scene-setting, and a specific social contract, which is what the Microsolidarity Network is creating."

"It felt like there's a large pool of wisdom that I can enter, and I don't have to be reluctant about it. I can share my problem even when I can't explain it very well, and people are open to listen to me and give me their thoughts."

"In this process I felt like how it feels when I confide in one of my close friends. These two people I had only just met, they were so focussed on listening to what I needed, and putting their best efforts into helping me... that's a very powerful feeling. They were there for me."
