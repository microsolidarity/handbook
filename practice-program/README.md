# Practice Program

In the first 2 weeks of October we're running a short cohort-based course to practice Microsolidarity and connect with other community builders.

**Join us** for this Practice Program if you want...

* to cultivate deeper connections and more collaboration within a network
* to initiate more learning, mutual aid, and a sense of belonging within your community
* to develop a work culture where people care about each other's wellbeing and growth



### About this program

This is a 2-week program. You can access [this short curriculum of videos & texts](course-content.md) to learn about the core concepts in your own time, and we will meet twice each week to experiment with relational practices (for a total of four 90-minute group calls). You'll also have access to a discussion forum to connect with other learners, share resources and ask us questions.



### Course Topics

* **Introduction** to microsolidarity
* **Dyads**: relational practices to develop a feeling of safety for more vulnerability and intimacy.
* **Crews**: key considerations and different formats for support in small groups.
* **Congregation**: case studies from different congregations, sharing how to start and maintain a self-organising network of crews.
* **Leadership & engagement**: how to encourage participation, engagement and co-leadership.
* **Reflection & learning**: how to get into the habit of reflection & continuous improvement, at a personal and collective level



### Time Commitment

* ​There are **four 90-minute live calls** where we’ll practice together
* We’ll send the video content at the beginning of each week so you can follow it at your own time. You can expect to spend around 30 minutes in preparation for each topic of the content.
* There will be a digital forum for connection, interaction, and Q\&A.



### Times & Dates

We meet for live calls on Tuesdays & Thursdays, for 2 weeks from Oct 3 to 12. You can choose which group you join, according to your timezone:&#x20;

* **Timezone A** meets at 9-10.30am CEST (3pm Singapore, 8pm Auckland)
* **Timezone B** meets at 6-7.30pm CEST (9am Los Angeles, 1pm Rio)
