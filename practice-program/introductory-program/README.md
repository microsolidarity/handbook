# Introductory Program

This April we're running a short cohort-based course to practice Microsolidarity and connect with other community builders.

**Join us** for this Practice Program if you want...

* to cultivate deeper connections and more collaboration within a network
* to initiate more learning, mutual aid, and a sense of belonging within your community
* to develop a work culture where people care about each other's wellbeing and growth



### About this program

This is a 2-week program. You can access [this short curriculum of videos & texts](course-content.md) to learn about the core concepts in your own time, and we will meet twice each week to experiment with relational practices (for a total of four 90-minute group calls). You'll also have access to a discussion forum to connect with other learners, share resources and ask us questions.



### Course Topics

* **Introduction** to microsolidarity
* **Dyads**: relational practices to develop a feeling of safety for more vulnerability and intimacy.
* **Crews**: key considerations and different formats for support in small groups.
* **Congregation**: case studies from different congregations, sharing how to start and maintain a self-organising network of crews.
* **Leadership & engagement**: how to encourage participation, engagement and co-leadership.
* **Reflection & learning**: how to get into the habit of reflection & continuous improvement, at a personal and collective level

### Time Commitment

* ​There are **four 90-minute live calls** where we’ll practice together
* You follow the course content in your own time. You can expect to spend around 30 minutes in preparation for each of the weekly topics.
* There is a digital forum for connection, interaction, and Q\&A.

### Testimonials

Here are some quotes from previous participants

"It was mindblowing how quickly you can develop trust and belonging - I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't experienced it. We created a feeling of trust and safety within a few minutes, it's bonkers!"

"I only spoke to 3 people and already I got such a strong feeling that I want to get to know everyone here - I don't often feel that in a random group of people."

"It’s so helpful to do these peer-support processes with people who are outside my community - it’s so valuable to get the perspective of someone who cares but is not involved. It's usually hard to find. it takes a lot of scene-setting, and a specific social contract, which is what the Microsolidarity Network is creating."

"It felt like there's a large pool of wisdom that I can enter, and I don't have to be reluctant about it. I can share my problem even when I can't explain it very well, and people are open to listen to me and give me their thoughts."

"In this process I felt like how it feels when I confide in one of my close friends. These two people I had only just met, they were so focussed on listening to what I needed, and putting their best efforts into helping me... that's a very powerful feeling. They were there for me."
