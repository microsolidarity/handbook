# Course Content

This online course content was originally developed as a training program for [The Hum](http://thehum.org). In 2023 we decided to open-source the content and share it with the world. On this page you'll find a curriculum of videos & texts covering the core concepts of Microsolidarity.&#x20;

It's much more interesting as a practice than a theory though, so consider joining us for the next 2-week online [Practice Program](./) :)

The Program includes 4 facilitated workshops to connect and practice with other community builders. Each of the workshops is connected to these 4 content modules:

1. [Introducing core concepts](1.-introducing-core-concepts.md)
2. [Crewing](2.-crewing.md)
3. [Congregations](3.-congregations.md)
4. [Leadership & Engagement](5.-resources-and-practices.md)
5. [Links, Resources & Practices](5.-resources-and-practices.md)
