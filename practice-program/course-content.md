# Course Content

This online course content was originally developed as a training program for [The Hum](http://thehum.org). In 2023 we decided to open-source the content and share it with the world. On this page you'll find a curriculum of videos & texts covering the core concepts of Microsolidarity. It's much more interesting as a practice than a theory though, so consider joining us for the next 2-week online [Practice Program](./) :)
