# Crewing Program

This program is a continuation of the Vibes Practice Program. We’ll dive deeper in to the why, what and how around crewing and practicing essential facilitation and leadership skills. Where the introductory Vibes program was all about experiencing what microsolidarity is about and practicing some basic relational building blocks, this program aims to answer questions like:

- “How do I create the vibe I experienced at the Practice Program in my own crew?”
- “I resonate with the theory of microsolidarity but how do I actually apply it?”
- “How do I start if I want to try crewing?”

We’ll specifically look at crewing as a core practice of microsolidarity and provide you with the basic principles and tools you need to get out there and start playing.

## Course Topics

- Exploring different types of crews and clarifying your calling around crewing
- Getting to know “the host within” and uncovering inhibiting parts dynamics -Practicing basic facilitation skills
- Understanding your role as a crew caller/ facilitator and how to support others to step in to their own leadership

## Learning outcomes

At the end of this program you’ll have everything you need to practice your hosting and community building skills through crewing.

## Your Hosts

This program was designed and hosting is led by Jocelyn Ames, Jonas Gröner, Gui Trevisan and Sara Bajor. They've been hosting the recent iterations of the Vibes Practice Program. After hearing participants longing for more applied practice at the end of the introductory program they decided to create this next offering in response to this longing.
