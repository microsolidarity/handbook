# Contributing Money

You can support the Microsolidarity Network by contributing on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/microsolidarity/).

Our fundraising goals are:

* to pay the facilitator for organising and hosting the monthly calls;
* to provide scholarships to make the paid events more accessible;
* to grow a common fund that can be used for anything that supports the network (e.g. editing the podcast or writing a book).

[Supporting us on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/microsolidarity) will give you access to the monthly members-only calls where you can meet other practitioners.

p.s. If youâ€™re interested in contributing with cryptocurrency, or you want to make a more substantial contribution, or you have fundraising ideas (e.g. grants to apply for) please get in touch!
