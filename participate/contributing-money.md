# Contributing Money

The intention is for the Microsolidarity Network to grow into a self-sustaining commons, governed by its participants, not for private profit nor under private control.

Initially, Richard Bartlett & Nati Lombardo used their private company [The Hum](http://thehum.org) as the legal & financial vehicle for running paid Microsolidarity events. As the network has matured, we've decided to create a clearer separation between Microsolidarity & The Hum.&#x20;

Since October 2022, we've set up 2 pages on Open Collective, an awesome legal & financial toolbox for grassroots groups. If you want to contribute money, there are two places you can donate:

1. [Microsolidarity](https://opencollective.com/microsolidarity), sponsored by Open Collective Europe. These donations are transacted in Euros and are hosted by a non-profit organization based in Belgium.&#x20;
2. [Microsolidarity Turtle Island](https://opencollective.com/microsolidarity-turtle-island), sponsored by Open Collective Foundation. These donations are transacted in US Dollars and are hosted by a non-profit organization based in the United States. They are tax-deductible under the US IRS 501(c)3 tax code.

Supporting us on Open Collective with at least €3 or $3 per month will give you access to the monthly members-only calls where you can meet other practitioners.

### Fundraising Goals

Our intention to grow a common fund that can be used for anything that supports the network. Here's some of our fundraising goals:

* to pay the facilitator for organising & hosting our monthly calls
* to provide scholarships to make paid events more accessible
* to produce media that supports the network & educates the wider public (e.g. editing the podcast, writing a book, making a Netflix series...)
* to pay for a "community coach" who can support a cohort of many microsolidarity community hosts
* to buy a retreat centre where communities can go for trainings & retreats.

### Decision-Making

The network is currently governed informally, with Richard Bartlett playing the role of "[benevolent dictator](https://communityrule.info/create/?r=1619810752488)". As we start to collect common resources, it seems natural that decision-making power should be shared with more people. Here's a proposed approach to get us started in that direction:

* all future paid events will be run through Open Collective
* all paid events that generate a surplus should contribute a percentage to the common fund
* anyone who has contributed money to the network is entitled to have a say about how the common fund is governed _(if you have contributed money, you should have access to the private #contributors channel on Discord - reach out to one of the admins if this is not the case)_
* "having a say" means you can make proposals for how we spend the collective money, and share your advice on other people's proposals
* final decisions are made by the administrators of the two Open Collective pages&#x20;
  * in Europe: Ulrich Schur, Michal Korzonek, Richard Bartlett
  * in the US: Alex Rodríguez, Drew Horbein, Richard Bartlett
* anyone can become an OC admin, by the approval of the existing admins
* for the time being, Richard Bartlett holds veto power, as a backstop in case of emergencies (e.g. irreconcilable conflict)
* we'll review this once or twice a year to ensure the system evolves to match the needs of the network
