By Theory U

# Overview

Case Clinics are a peer support practice for a group of 3 - 5 people. The process guides one Case Giver to present a case, and the remaining team members to help generate new and innovative ways of responding to the challenge or question. A Case Clinic can be run in-person or online.

# Roles

**Case Giver:** Share a challenge that is current, concrete, important, and that you are a key

player in. You should be able to present the case in 10 min and the case should stand to

benefit from the feedback of your peers.

**Coaches:** Do not try to "fix" the problem, but listen deeply to the case giver while also

attending to the images, metaphors, feelings and gestures that the story evokes in you.

**Timekeeper:** Make sure you are moving through the sequence approximately on time.

(You’re also participating as a coach.)

# Sequence

1. Read thru these instructions & choose a timekeeper (3 min)

2. Intention statement by case giver (10 min)

    * Current situation: What key challenge or question are you up against?

    * Stakeholders: How might others view this situation?

    * Intention: What future are you trying to create?

    * Learning threshold: What do you need to let-go of? what do you need to learn?

    * Help: Where do you need input or help?

    * Coaches listen deeply and may ask clarifying questions (don’t give advice!)

3. Stillness (2 min)

    * Sit quietly together for a few moments. Listen to what is bubbling up in you. What images, metaphors, feelings and gestures come up for you that capture the essence of what you heard?

4. Mirroring (10 min)

    * Each coach shares the images/metaphors, feelings and gestures that came up in the stillness, or while listening to the case story (still not giving advice!)

    * Having listened to all coaches, the case giver reflects back on what they heard

5. Generative Dialogue (20 min)

    * All reflect on remarks by the case giver and move into a generative dialogue on how these observations can offer new perspectives on the case giver’s situation and journey. Go with the flow of the dialogue. Build on each other’s ideas. Make space for all voices. Stay in service of the case giver without pressure to fix or resolve their challenge.

6. Round of closing remarks (10 min)

    * Coaches: final words

    * Case giver: How do I now see my situation and way forward?
