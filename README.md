# Microsolidarity

### Microsolidarity is a community-building practice. We're weaving the social fabric that underpins shared infrastructure.

The first objective of microsolidarity is to create **structures for belonging**. We are stitching new kinship networks to shift us out of isolated individualism into a more connected way of being. Why? Because **belonging is a superpower**: we’re more courageous & creative when we "find our people".

The second objective is to support people into **meaningful work.** This is very broadly defined: you decide what is meaningful to you. It could be about your job, your family, or community volunteering. Generally, life is more meaningful when we are **being of benefit to others**, when we know how to contribute, when we can match our talents to the needs in the world.
