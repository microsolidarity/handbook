# Microsolidarity

In late 2018, Richard D. Bartlett published a [proposal](articles/proposal.md) to start a "microsolidarity" group — a small mutual aid community for people to do a kind of personal development, in good company, for social benefit.

Since then, an open research network has been gradually self-organising around this concept and these practices. 

This website is the central hub to collect resources for the co-development of multiple such communities. Read through the [articles](articles/) to understand the project. You'll find [methods for cultivating Crews](crewing/) for peer-to-peer support in tiny groups.

**Microsolidarity Practice Week** is happening in June 2020, [details here](https://www.thehum.org/microsolidarity).

You can check out some recorded conversations on [this YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOjcWjpjOqzbV9T3tSR6O7z_eic-Puqaa) or [this podcast feed](https://anchor.fm/microsolidarity) and be sure to [join the Loomio group](http://loomio.org/microsolidarity) if you want to connect with other practitioners.

### Definition of terms

The proposal introduces some specific use of language:

**Microsolidarity** is a set of practices for mutual support between peers. These methods bring us out of individualism and into a more relational way of being. 

Most of this support happens in a **Crew**: a small group up to about 8 people growing trust in each other through emotional & economic reciprocity. Crews are always designed for intimacy, and may also produce an output \(e.g. a software product or an activist campaign\).

The **Congregation** is a space for Crews to co-develop in the company of other Crews. Congregations have less than a few hundred people, so they can be primarily governed through trust and dialogue.

Many Congregations could form an **Assembly**. 

_For more context on these definitions, read the original_ [_proposal_](articles/proposal.md)_._
